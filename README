Bake: A Better Make

Bake is a C++ build system, similar to Make. It aims to ease configuration of 
C++ projects, and thus ease C++ development without the need for an Integrated
Development Environment.

Bake includes:

- A simpler configuration file format
- Support for multiple projects
- Automatic build dependency generation
